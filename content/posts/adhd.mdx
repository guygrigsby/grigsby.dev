The plan for this blog was to document my front end journey. As you may be able to see, I haven't done shit. Thus there has been nothing to document. As such, I think I am just going to blog about whatever. Hopefully there is some tech and some personal stuff too. After all, I am an engineer and I am also a person. The part that I really have a hard time with the people part. Engineering is easy. 

One of the things that make engineering easy and peopling hard is just part of who I am. I have ADHD. It's really hard for me to focus on things _except_ those things in which I am super interested. As it turns out, I am _super_ interested in building software and learning tech. I am _not_, on the other hand, super interested in most things interpersonal. Thus my strength becomes my weakness. 

Seems I have had it my whole life, but was just diagnosed less than a year ago. Approaching 40 and just diagnosed with a disorder that only children have. That's what I thought. Turn out adults have it too and a lot of adults go undiagnosed nd untreated. I am trying to find the right treatment. Trying different meds with my doctor until we get the right one. I hope it happens soon. It has been pretty frustrating. 

This is just what I am thinking about right now and I wanted to write it down. There it is. Happy Friday.
