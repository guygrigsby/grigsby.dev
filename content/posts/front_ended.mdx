So, I haven't done anything here at all. You might have noticed if anyone actually read this. Whatevs. I think I'll just turn it into a blog about everything!

Today, I am going to try to use split.io to get some sweet sweet feature flagging going. We need to be able to route a percentage of payments to a new flow and split.io is the solution that was chosen. Hopefully I will write it up later.
