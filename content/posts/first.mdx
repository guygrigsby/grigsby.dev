Hi there! I am creating this blog to document my journey into the world of front end development. 

I have always thought it would be cool to be able to create a beautiful website. I finally decided to do it.I chose to use [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://gatsby.org) because I have heard good things about React and I wanted it to be fast. It seems like websites keep getting slower and I am sick of it.

I have to say, so far it is really easy. Gatsby has a [template](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/using-a-theme/) for this blog so I am a full 5 minutes in. I am impressed.

Deployment is being done directly from [github.com](https://github.com) through [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and that is fucking easy too! The hardest part has been the https because I had to change my DNS to Netlify and wait for changes to propagate. Basically, looping over this `curl -s -v http://grigsby.dev 2>&1 | ag Server` every few seconds. Netifly even makes that part pretty painless with step-by-step instructions in the "Domain Management" section of your site settings.

Along with this blog, the source code for it will be available on [my github](https://github.com/guygrigsby/grigsby.dev). I invite you to follow along!
