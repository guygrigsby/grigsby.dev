Hi there! I am creating this blog to document my journey into the world of front end development. 

I have always thought it would be cool to be able to create a beautiful website. I finally decided to do it.I chose to use ([React.js](https://reactjs.org/)) ([Gatsby](httpsd://gatsby.org)) because I have heard good things about React and I wanted it to be fast. It seems like websites keep getting slower and I am sick of it.

I have to say, so far it is really easy. Gatsby has a ([template](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/using-a-theme/)) for this blog so I am a full 5 minutes in. I am impressed.

Along with this blog, the source code for it will be available on ([my github](https://github.com/guygrigsby/grigsby.dev)). I invite you to follow along!
